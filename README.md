# CS330-SceneShowcase
Redered 3D created in C++ and OpenGL
 Through my project work, I have honed various design skills that were new to me, particularly in the realm of C++ and OpenGL. One such skill is Requirement Analysis, which involves comprehending and documenting the software project's needs, goals, and specifications. 
 I gained experience in gathering requirements from stakeholders, conducting interviews, and analyzing existing systems or processes.
In terms of the design process I followed for my project work, I believe I primarily embraced the Agile methodology. 
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. 
It allowed me to adapt to evolving requirements and work closely with my team throughout the project. 
Additionally, one could argue that I also adopted the Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach. 
Given the fast-paced nature of this class and the need to complete the project within a tight timeframe, 
I prioritized rapid prototyping and iterative development.
The tactics employed in my design approach can be highly applicable to future work. 
This class served as a real-life exposure to a complex project with strict deadlines. 
Such experiences are invaluable for preparing me to tackle challenging scenarios in my development career. 
There will inevitably be instances where I might encounter unfamiliar projects with looming deadlines. However, by drawing upon the lessons learned during this course, 
I have developed the resilience and determination necessary to overcome obstacles. 
The ability to teach myself the C++ language and OpenGL simultaneously, while navigating through an accelerated class, 
has equipped me with the mindset and skills needed to succeed even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges.
